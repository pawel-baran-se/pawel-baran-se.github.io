                    As a structural engineer with a Master's degree, I have a strong foundation in solving complex problems and applying algorithms on a daily basis.

                    <br/>
                    After more than 7 years of experience in this field, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and real-world problem-solving experience to my work.

                    My desire to automate and streamline these processes led me to start learning how to code in C#, and I have been consistently improving my skills through dedicated practice and attendance at a professional Bootcamp.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I have completed an MBA, which has given me a deeper understanding of how companies operate and equipped me with the knowledge and skills to be an effective leader and project manager.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I am eager to use my technical abilities and business acumen to help others streamline their work and drive successful projects.</div>
